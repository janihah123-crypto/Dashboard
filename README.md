This Project is a little Dashboard made with an Raspberry PI and Touchdisplay. On it there are many Informations like Clock, Weather, Vacations, my Calender and the Top News. On the second Site I can controll my Smart Home and see my CCTV Camera.

I made this, because I want to have a Display mounted in my Wall, where I can controll everything and be always on the latest update for like news or so. 

Later I want to include a Bell, that my dashboard shows me when someone rings at my door, but thats for the next version.
